<p><span style="font-size:0.86em">Meanwhile, Mohd Nor (2010) examined the awareness and ownership of family takaful plan among Muslim community in Kuala Lumpur. His study is attempted to obtain a deeper understanding of the relationship between levels of awareness and the purchase of family takaful plan. The results of the study indicate that the level of awareness is very high. It was identified that the level of awareness has significant positive relationship with respondents’ ownership of family takaful plan. Whereas, a study by Omar (2010) has found that the perception of customers of Prudential BSN Family takaful and Prudential Life Insurance that takaful plan would guarantee savings and protection to them. Besides, the study also found that from customers’ perception that Shariah Supervisory Council plays an important role in ensuring the implementation of takaful in Malaysia.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:0.86em">It is worth noting that issues relating to takaful have always been discussed but little empirical study on the determinants of family takaful demand has been conducted. Obviously, from the previous literature, there is very limited research focusing on family takaful. Thus, it can be concluded that many researchers may have less interest to explore issues related family takaful as compared to the conventional life insurance. The main reason could be family takaful is still at its infancy stage. Among earlier study on family takaful is conducted Redzuan et al. (2009) by using economic factors as determinants of family takaful demand. Their study aim to identify the driving force of family takaful consumption in Malaysia. The main finding of the study indicated that income per capita is a robust predictor of family takaful demand, while long term interest rate and composite stock index have significant relationship with family takaful demand. A study by Yusoff (2009) also explored the determinants of the demand for family takaful in Malaysia. In this study, they investigated both of the economic and socio-demographic factors in order to determine the consumption of family takaful which is slightly difference with study of Redzuan et al. (2009) in terms of variables used. Among demographic factors, this study indicated that income, Islamic banking development, education, dependency ratio, and Muslim population factors are positively related to family takaful demand. On the other hand, among economic factors, it is found that inflation, real interest rate, financial development and life expectancy appear to be the significant factors that influence the family takaful demand in Malaysia.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:0.86em">In addition to this literature, the studies of Islamic finance as well as Islamic banking which related to the issue were also being reviewed to understand the factors on selection of Islamic institutions which can be applied into this current study on determinants of family takaful demand. For example, a survey by Gait and Worthington (2008) have found that religion is the main factor considered by customers in Islamic finance, although further pricing, bank reputation and quality of service are also very important criteria for bank customers. This is supported by Al-Ajmi et al. (2009) who revealed that Islamic religious belief and social responsibility are the two most important factors while cost benefit is the third most important factor considered in determine bank selection. Adnan (2010) has examined the choice determinants of Islamic banking institution among Muslims in Terengganu. This survey has found eight determinants factors consists of halal (permitted) and haram (forbidden) consideration, quality consumption, maslahah return, consumption according to priority, reputation and recommendation, characteristics of products and services, convenience, and marketing and advertising. He also has examined the relationship of these determinants with the demographic and religious adherence factors.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:0.86em">Amin et al. (2011) investigated the effects of the following factors: attitude; social influence; religious obligation; government support; and pricing, on the intention to use Islamic personal financing. The study has found that only three determinants to be significant in influencing the intention to use Islamic personal financing namely attitude, social influence, and pricing of Islamic personal financing. Whereas, religious obligation and government support are found to be insignificant predictors.</span></p>
